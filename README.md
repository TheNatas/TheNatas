# ❓ About me
  
</div>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi. I'm Natanael - as you can tell - and that's my Github page. I'm 21 years old and I started to study computer science during the pandemic, in the middle of 2020. At first, I just wanted to learn what I had to in order to develop my very own games, so I began a Java course. I had zero background on coding at the time, so I gave up of learning it as a primary language, which took me to a friendlier environment for newbies like me: Web development. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but I still felt like needing a better comprehension of what programming was, so I ended up falling on CS50, where I could acquire the fundamental understanding that I was searching for. Now, I'm closer to web than game development and I actually love it. I know I'm young enough, so I want to enjoy the time I have for shooting different directions and see what I can get.
